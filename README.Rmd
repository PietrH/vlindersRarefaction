The goal of vlindersRarefaction is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of vlindersRarefaction from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PietrH/vlindersRarefaction")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(vlindersRarefaction)
## load some input data
warande <- readr::read_delim("../tblWarandepark.csv", delim = ";")
## convert to formats iNEXT is expecting
convert_to_incidence_freq(warande)
convert_to_abundance(warande)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
